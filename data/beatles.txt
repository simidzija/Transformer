You know, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me, too
But I got a big surprise, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I want to go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you, oh

You, if you break my heart, I'll go
But I'll be back again

Can't buy me love, oh
Love, oh
Can't buy me love, oh

I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend
If it makes you feel all right
I'll get you anything my friend
If it makes you feel all right

'Cause I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I got I'll give to you

I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love, oh
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, oh
No, no, no, no

Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy

I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love, ow

Buy me love
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, oh
No, no, no, no

Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy

I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

Can't buy me love, oh
Love, oh
Buy me love, oh

All you gotta do is call

Just look into my eyes

If you're feeling sorry and sad
I'd really sympathise
Don't you be sad
Just call me tonight

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all

If the sun has faded away
I'll try to make it shine

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything

So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I'll feel okay

When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
Ow!

So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah

Ooh, it's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know, I feel all right
You know, I feel all right

I've got every reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday

And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then, I'll cry instead

Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday

And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls
'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then, I'll cry instead

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart
To you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you
Would love me more than her

If I trust in you
Oh, please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too
Oh, please
Don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

So I hope you see
That I
Would love to love you
And that she
Will cry
When she learns we are two
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

So I hope you see
That I
Would love to love you
And that she
Will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you

I got something to say
That might cause you pain
If I catch you talking
To that boy again
I'm gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

Well, it's the second time
I've caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time
I think it's a sin?
I think I'll let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

Everybody's green
'Cos I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

So, please listen to me
If you want to stay mine
I can't help my feelings
I'd go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

You can't do that

Everybody's green
'Cos I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

So, please listen to me
If you want to stay mine
I can't help my feelings
I'd go out of my mind
I'll go and let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do

Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

So I should have realised a lot of things before
If this is love you gotta give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more

Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
You love me too
You love me too
You love me too

Till I walk out that door
Again

And why you lied to me

If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is love
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on

She gives me everything and tenderly
The kiss my lover brings, she brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours could never die
As long as I have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky
I know this love of mine will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky
I know this love of mine will never die

Joan was quizzical, 
Studied pataphysical science in the home 
Late nights all alone with a test tube 
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine 
Calls her on the phone 
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Jo-oh-oh-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go 
A knock comes on the door 

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head 
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure she was dead 

Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed 
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene 
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away 
So he waits behind 
Writing fifty times "I must not be so, oh-oh, oh"
But when she turns her back on the boy 
He creeps up from behind 

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head (do-do do-doo-doo)
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead 

(Do-do do-doo-doo)

P.C. 31 said "We've caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone 
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh-oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free ("Maxwell must go free")
The judge does not agree, and he tells them so, oh-oh, oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind 

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head (do-do do-doo-doo)
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead 
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh

(Do-do do-doo-doo)

Silver hammer man
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm
Below the storm 
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head
On the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh, what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(happy and they're safe)
We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
Oh yeah
All right
Are you gonna be in my dreams
Tonight?

Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say

Little darlin'
It's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darlin'
It feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darlin'
The smiles returning to their faces
Little darlin'
It seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darlin'
I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darlin'
It seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say

Believe me when I beg you - ooh!
Don't ever leave me alone

When you told me
You didn't need me any more
Well, you know, I nearly
Broke down and cried

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But, oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
(Ahhhhh ah-ahhhh-a-ah)
(Ahhhhh ah-ahhhh-a-ah)
(Ahhhhh ah-ah a-ah a-ah)

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags, get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true
Today
Came true
Today
Came true
Today
Yes, it did
'N ah ah ah ah ah ah-h ah

Shaves in the dark

Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

Takes him out to look at the Queen

Always shouts out something obscene

All these years I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you

I've got a feeling
That keeps me on my toes

Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day

I me me mine
I me me mine
I me me mine

All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears

Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through your life

My baby says she's travelling
On the one after 909

Move over honey 
I'm travelling on that line
I said
Move over once
Move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go 
And I begged her on my bended knee (yes, I did)
You're only fooling 'round
Only fooling 'round with me

Move over once 
Move over twice 
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

Pick up my bags, run to the station

Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's hard-earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters on my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road
That stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road
That stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun

The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

And still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
(Don't keep me waiting)
Lead me to your door

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I want you at the moment I feel blue 
I'm living every moment, girl, for you 

Walk, walk, cat, walk
Go, Johnny, go!
Same old twelve-bar blues

Elmore James got nothin' on this, baby!

I loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me, that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I'm having the blues
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Jai guru deva
Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
And calls me on and on across the universe

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

I love you
'Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
That it really only goes to show
That I know that I
Should never, never, never be blue

Now you're mine
My happiness, dear, makes me cry
And in time
You'll understand the reason why
If I cry, it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

I can't believe
It's happened to me
I can't conceive
Of any more 
Misery

Ask me why
I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

Girl, before you go now

That I still love you so
But if he loves you more

Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la

It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart
Many many many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself

'Cos, baby, it's you
Baby, it's you (Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la!)

You should hear what they say about you
Cheat, cheat
They say, they say you never never never ever been true (Cheat, cheat)
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, when it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody

'Cos, baby, it's you
Baby, it's you (Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la!)

'Cos, baby, it's you
Baby, it's you (Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!)
Don't leave me all alone
Come on home

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone

I think of you
And things you do
Go 'round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"

In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so?
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so?

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone

There's a place

A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

Doo doo n'doo
Doo doo n'doo

I dream of your
First kiss and then
I feel upon
My lips again

A taste of honey (A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

Oh, I will return
Yes, I will return
I'll come back
For the honey and you

Yours was the kiss
That awoke my heart
There lingers still
Though we're far apart

That taste of honey
(A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

Oh, I will return
Yes, I will return
I'll come back (He'll come back)
For the honey (For the honey)
And you

Chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind
That you can see
Oh-oh, these chains of love
Got a hold on me, yeah

Chains
Well, I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around
'Cause I'm not free
Oh-oh, these chains of love
Won't let me be, yeah

I wanna tell you, pretty baby
I think you're fine
I'd like to love you
But, darling, I'm imprisoned by these

Chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind
That you can see
Oh-oh, these chains of love
Got a hold on me, yeah

Your lips are sweet
I'd like to kiss them
But I can't break away from all of these

Chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind
That you can see
Oh-oh, these chains of love
Got a hold on me, yeah

Chains

Chains of love

As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you

Treasure these few words
'Til we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

I'll be coming home again to you, love
And 'til the day I do, love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

You, you, you
You, you, you
I love you

One, two, three, four!

Well, she was just seventeen
If you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there?

Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoa, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another
Since I saw her standing there
Whoa, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there

You'll never know how much I really love you
You'll never know how much I really care

Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?

Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you

Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you

I've known a secret for a week or two
Nobody knows
Just we two

Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you

The world is treating me bad
Misery

I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad
Misery

I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag
Misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one?
Only one

Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be
In misery

I'll remember all the little things we've done
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one
Lonely one

Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be
In misery
In misery
My misery
Misery

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me
It's not my mind
That is confusing things

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever
I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind
And tell you
Maybe you'd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever
I've got time

I've got time
Your day breaks
Your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up
She makes up
She takes her time
And doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her
You need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home
She goes out
She says that long ago
She knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks
Your mind aches
There will be times
When all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float upstream (float upstream)

Please don't wake me
No, don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (there's no need)

Please don't spoil my day
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling

Please don't spoil my day
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float upstream (float upstream)

Please don't wake me
No, don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
Ring my friend

Don't pay money just to see yourself
With Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert
You're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can
Doc Robert

Well, well, well
You're feeling fine
Well, well, well
He'll make you
Doctor Robert

Ring my friend
I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
Ring my friend
I said you'd call Doc Robert
Doctor Robert
Turn off your mind
Relax and float down stream
It is not dying
It is not dying

Lay down all thought
Surrender to the void
It is shining
It is shining

That you may see
The meaning of within
It is being
It is being

That love is all
And love is everyone
It is knowing
It is knowing

That ignorance and hate
May mourn the dead
It is believing
It is believing

But listen to the
Colour of your dreams
It is not living
It is not living

Or play the game
Existence to the end
Of the beginning
Of the beginning

Of the beginning
She said
"I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad"
And she's making me feel like
I've never been born

I said
"Who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like
I've never been born"

She said, "You don't understand what I said."
I said, "No, no, no. You're wrong.
When I was a boy,
Everything was right.
Everything was right."

I said
"Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cos you're making me feel like
I've never been born."

She said, "You don't understand what I said."
I said, "No, no, no. You're wrong.
When I was a boy,
Everything was right.
Everything was right."

I said
"Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cos you're making me feel like
I've never been born."

She said, she said
"I know what it's like to be dead.
I know what it's like to be dead.
I know what it is to be sad.
I know what it is to be sad.
I know what it's like to be dead.
I know what it's like to be dead."
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man

A life time is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins, you'll see

I'll make love to you
If you want me to
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?
To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her

Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her

Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never die
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine

I need to laugh
And when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good
In a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day

Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine

We take a walk
The sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine

Then we lie
Beneath the shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good (she does)
She knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine

Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day)
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You know I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life
Somehow, someway

What can I do? What can I be?
When I'm with you I wanna stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

Got to get you into my life
I've got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And then I suddenly see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day?
One, two, three, four (for you, nineteen for me)
One, two (one, two, three, four)

Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

(If you drive a car, car)
I'll tax the street
(If you try to sit, sit)
I'll tax your seat
(If you get too cold, cold)
I'll tax the heat
(If you take a walk, walk)
I'll tax your feet
Taxman

'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

Don't ask me what I want it for
(Ha, ha, Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more
(Ha, ha, Mr. Heath)
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
(Taxman)
Declare the pennies on your eyes
(Taxman)
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one but me (Taxman)
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Full steam ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye
Captain, captain

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Every one of us (every one of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine, ha-ha!)

We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me

You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me

When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round
I'll be 'round

When your bird is broken 
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken 
I'll be 'round
I'll be 'round

You tell me that you heard every sound there is 
And your bird can swing 
But you can't hear me 
You can't hear me
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hour glass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies in summer
Meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane
Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Ohh oh-oh-oh-oh ohh-oh-oh
Round and round and round and round and round
He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fool
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Ohhhh
Round and round and round and round and
Ohhhh
There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends have lost their way
"We'll be over soon", they said
Now they've lost themselves instead

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

Well, it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet

Please don't be long (don't be long)
Please don't you be very long (don't be long)
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

Now, it's past my bed, I know (know)
And I'd really like to go (go)
Soon will be the break of day (day)
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way (Way)

Please don't be long (don't be long)
Please don't you be very long (don't be long)
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long

Don't be long
Don't be long
Don't be long
Don't be long

Don't be long
Don't be long
Don't be long

Baby, You're a Rich Man
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be?
And have you travelled very far?
Far as the eye can see

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show

Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo
What a thing to do!
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?

Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag

I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here
So I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone
Please let me know

I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong
I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her

I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here
So I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone
Please let me know

Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her

Though I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong
I've waited far too long
If I think I'll take a walk and look for her
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask, I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Ooh, I need your love, babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love, babe
Just like I need you

Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me
I ain't got nothin' but love, babe
Eight days a week

Love you every day, girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say, girl
Love you all the time

Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me
I ain't got nothin' but love, girl
Eight days a week

Eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care

Ooh, I need your love, babe
Yes, you know it's true
Hope you need my love, babe
Just like I need you

Oh, hold me, love me
Hold me, love me
I ain't got nothin' but love, babe
Eight days a week

Eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care

Love you every day, girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say, girl
Love you all the time

Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me
I ain't got nothin' but love, babe
Eight days a week

Eight days a week
Eight days a week
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my love on over 'cross the tracks
And she declaim a man a wailin' sax
I must admit they had a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' homebrew from a wooden cup
The folks were dancin' and got all shook up

And started playin' that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear them play a tango
I'm in no mood to take a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
So keep on rockin' that piano

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a black beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oughta got rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh, what can I do?

She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

I think of her
But she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim

Oh, how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?

And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now

Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, ooh

When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes, I know that she loves me now
There is one thing I'm sure of
I will love her forever
For I know love will never die

Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, ooh

Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, ooh

Every little thing
Every little thing
Look what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

You got me running
And there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me

Please, stop your lying
You got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me

You have got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

Mr. Moonlight

You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you send my girl
And from above you sent us love
And now she is mine
I think you're fine
'Cos we love you
Mr. Moonlight

Well, honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
I say you will when you won't
Uh-uh, honey, don't

Well I love you, baby, and you ought to know
I like the way that you wear your clothes
Everything about you is so doggone sweet
You got that sand all over your feet

But ah-ah
Well, honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
Honey, don't
I say you will when you won't
Ah-ah, honey, don't

Well, sometimes I love you on a Saturday night
Sunday morning you don't look right
You've been out painting the town
Ah-ah, baby, been stepping around

But ah-ah
Well, honey, don't

Ah-ah, honey, don't
This happened once before when I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you, but I saw you peep through
Your window

I saw the light
I saw the light
I know that you saw me 'cause I looked up to see
Your face

I tried to telephone, they said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been and I saw you walk in
Your door

I nearly died
I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand with another man
In my place

If I were you I'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

I've tried to telephone, they said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been and I saw you walk in
Your door

I nearly died
I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

No reply
No reply
One day you'll look 
To see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

Some day you'll know 
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oh

One day you'll find 
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

Yeah, tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oh

One day you'll find 
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
Well, they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now

Woke up last night, half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door

Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now

Went out last night, I didn't stay late
'Fore I got home I had a-nineteen dates

Everybody's trying to be my baby

If I needed someone to love 
You're the one that I'd be thinking of 
If I needed someone 

If I had some more time to spend 
Then I guess I'd be with you, my friend
If I needed someone 
Had you come some other day 
Then it might not have been like this 
But, you see, now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall 
And maybe you will get a call from me 
If I needed someone 

Ah, ah, ah, ah 

If I had some more time to spend 
Then I guess I'd be with you, my friend
If I needed someone 
Had you come some other day 
Then it might not have been like this 
But, you see, now I'm too much in love 

Carve your number on my wall 
And maybe you will get a call from me 
If I needed someone 

Ah, ah
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said, "Baby, can't you see?
I wanna be famous, a star of the screen
But you can do something in between

Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you"

I told that girl that my prospects were good
And she said, "Baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time

Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you"
Beep beep mm beep beep, yeah

Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

I told that girl I could start right away
When she said, "Listen, babe, I got something to say
I got no car and it's breaking my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start

Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you"

Beep-beep mm beep-beep, yeah
Beep-beep mm beep-beep, yeah
Beep-beep mm beep-beep, yeah
Beep-beep mm beep-beep, yeah
Beep-beep mm beep-beep, yeah
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day

Ah, girl
Girl, girl

When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

Ah, girl
Girl, girl

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
She's cool, ooh ooh ooh

Girl
Girl, girl

Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

Ah, girl
Girl, girl

Ah, girl
Girl, girl
There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no-one compares with you (ooh-ooh-ooh)
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

In my life I love you more
Say the word and you'll be free 
Say the word and be like me 
Say the word I'm thinking of 
Have you heard the word is love? 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love 
In the beginning I misunderstood 
But now I've got it
The word is good

Spread the word and you'll be free 
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love? 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love 
Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read

Say the word and you'll be free 
Say the word and be like me 
Say the word I'm thinking of 
Have you heard the word is love? 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love 
Now that I know what I feel must be right 
I'm here to show everybody the light 

Give the word a chance to say 
That the word is just the way 
It's the word I'm thinking of 
And the only word is love 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love

Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word
Love
I once had a girl or should I say
She once had me
She showed me her room, isn't it good
Norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said:
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn't it good
Norwegian wood?
Well, I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You'd better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am

You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

Well, you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life trying
Just to make you toe the line

You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead

You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
I catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You'd better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

I'm looking through you 
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you 
What did I know?
You don't look different 
But you have changed 
I'm looking through you 
You're not the same 

Your lips are moving 
I cannot hear 
Your voice is soothing
But the words aren't clear 
You don't sound different 
I've learned the game 
I'm looking through you 
You're not the same 

Why, tell me why 
Did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit 
Of disappearing overnight 

You're thinking of me 
The same old way 
You were above me 
But not today 
The only difference 
Is you're down there 
I'm looking through you
And you're nowhere 

Why, tell me why 
Did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit 
Of disappearing overnight 

I'm looking through you 
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you 
What did I know?
You don't look different 
But you have changed 
I'm looking through you 
You're not the same 

Yeah, oh, baby, you've changed
Aah, and I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you 
A-you've changed, you've changed 
You've changed, you've changed
Yes, you've changed
I'm looking
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere man, please listen (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
You don't know what you're missing (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
Nowhere man (aaah-ah-la-la-la)

Nowhere man, can you see me at all?

Nowhere man, don't worry (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
Take your time; don't hurry (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
Leave it all (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
Till somebody else lends you a hand (aaah-aah-lala-lala)

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why 

What goes on in your heart?

I used to think of no-one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
It's been a long time 
Now I'm coming back home 
I've been away now 
Oh, how I've been alone 

Wait
Till I come back to your side 
We'll forget the tears we cried 

But if your heart breaks 
Don't wait
Turn me away 
And if your heart's strong 
Hold on
I won't delay 

Wait
Till I come back to your side 
We'll forget the tears we cried 

I feel as though 
You ought to know 
That I've been good 
As good as I can be 
And if you do

And know that you 
Will wait for me 

It's been a long time

We'll forget the tears we cried 

It's been a long time 
Now I'm coming back home 
I've been away now 
Oh, how I've been alone

But I'm to blame, it's plain to see

So go away, leave me alone
Don't bother me

I can't believe
That she would leave me on my own
It's just not right
When every night I'm all alone

I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

But till she's here
Please don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know
When she's come home, until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me

I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

But till she's here
Please don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know
When she's come home, until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me
In sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Till there was you

Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

All my loving

She's got the devil in her heart
But her eyes they tantalise
She's gonna tear your heart apart
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me

I'll take my chances
For romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

She's got the devil in her heart
No, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no, nay will she deceive

I can't believe that she'll ever ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
Listen, can't you see?

She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no, nay will she deceive

Don't take chances
If your romance is
So important to you
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me

Oh, no, no, no, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no, nay will she deceive

No, she's an angel sent to me
She's got the devil in her heart
No, she's an angel sent to me

We're gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rockin' little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over, Beethoven
Gotta hit it again today

You know, my temperature's risin'
And the jukebox blown a fuse
My heart beatin' rhythm
And my soul keeps a-singing the blues
Roll over, Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got a rockin' pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I caught it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm revues
Roll over, Beethoven
Rockin' in two by two

Well, if you feel it and like it
Well, get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up just a
Trifle further and a-reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over, Beethoven
A-rockin' in two by two

Well, early in the mornin'
I'm a givin' you the warnin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey, diddle, diddle
I'm a-playin' my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over, Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she winks like a glow worm
Dives like a spinnin' top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see him reel an' rock
'S long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

Well, roll over, Beethoven
Yeah, roll over, Beethoven
Roll over, Beethoven
Oh, roll over, Beethoven
Roll over, Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

It was twenty years ago today
That Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's gonna sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, yeah
Billy Shears
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Nothing to say but "What a day, how's your boy been?"
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"

Good morning
Good morning 
Good morning

Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town

Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"

Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

People running 'round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet the Wife

Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"

Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good

Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good

Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking-glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh

Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in the ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me?

Rita

Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home and nearly made it
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two

Oh lovely Rita, meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you

Lovely Rita, meter maid

They'll never believe it
It's getting better all the time

I used to get mad at my school (Now I can't complain)
The teachers that taught me weren't cool (No I can't complain)
You're holding me down (Ah), turning me 'round (Oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Fool)

I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time

It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)

I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can

I admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
Yes I admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time

It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)

Getting so much better all the time
One, two, three, four
Bye

Woo!

We're sorry but it's time to go

Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's lonely

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We'd like to thank you once again
Sgt. Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's getting very near the end

Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Woo!
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends

What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

No I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm get high with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you but I know it's mine

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm get high with a little help from my friends
Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
When I get older, losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a Valentine?
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?

If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings, go for a ride

Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save (we shall scrimp and save)
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely wasting away

Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

I'm painting the room in a colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
Silly people run around
They worry me and never ask me
Why they don't get past my door

I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

(One)

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
(Huh, huh, huh, huh)

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah
Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah

I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's fair, what a scene

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world

The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late

Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground

Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
Wednesday morning at five o'clock
As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the back door key
Stepping outside she is free

She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye bye)
For so many years

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
"Daddy, our baby's gone"
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?

She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye bye)
For so many years

Friday morning at nine o'clock
She is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She (What did we do that was wrong?)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (Bye bye)
For so many years

She's leaving home
Bye bye
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pass away

We were talking about the love we all could share when we find it
To try our best to hold it there
With our love
With our love we could save the world
If they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know
They can't see
Are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see
We're all one and life flows on within you and without you
Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

One more time
Dear Prudence
Won't you come out to play?
Dear Prudence
Greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful, and so are you
Dear Prudence
Won't you come out to play?

Dear Prudence
Open up your eyes
Dear Prudence
See the sunny skies
The wind is low, the birds will sing
That you are part of everything
Dear Prudence
Won't you open up your eyes?

Look around, 'round
('Round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round)
Look around, 'round, 'round
('Round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round)
Look around

Dear Prudence
Let me see you smile
Dear Prudence
Like a little child
The clouds will be a daisy chain
So let me see you smile again
Dear Prudence
Won't you let me see you smile?

Dear Prudence
Won't you come out to play?
Dear Prudence
Greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful, and so are you
Dear Prudence
Won't you come out to play?
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

I hear the clock a-ticking
On the mantel shelf
See the hands a-moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said, that's all right
I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you

Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Oh
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC 
Didn't get to bed last night 
On the way the paper bag was on my knee 
Man, I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the USSR

Been away so long I hardly knew the place 
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case 
Honey, disconnect the phone

You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S.
Back in the U.S.

Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I'm back in the USSR
Hey!
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the USSR

Oh, let me tell you, honey
Hey, I'm back
I'm back in the USSR
Hey, it's so good to be here
Yeah, back in the USSR
I'm back!
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly
Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird fly
Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

The worm he licks my bone
Feel so suicidal 
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jone
Lonely

The black cloud crossed my mind 
Blue mist 'round my soul 
Feel so suicidal 
Even hate my rock and roll

Yes, I'm lonely
Wanna die

Girl, you know the reason why

In the morning
Wanna die
In the evening

Creme tangerine, Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Cool cherry cream, nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues (whoo)
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You might not feel it now
When the pain cuts through
You're gonna know, and how!
The sweat is gonna fill your head (whoa)
When it becomes too much, you'll shout aloud

But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now turns so sour
We all know o-bla-di-bla-da
But can you show me where you are?

Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news (whoo)
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Yes, you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Desmond has a barrow at the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (rin-ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing (sing)

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da (la-la-la-la la-la-)
Life goes on, bra (la-la la-la-la-laaa)
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da (la-la-la-la la-la-)
Life goes on, bra (la-la la-la-la-laaa)
La-la, how the life goes on
Yeah

In a couple of years
They have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (ha ha ha ha)

Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand (arm!) (leg!)
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

Yes!
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Hey!
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on

In a couple of years
They have built a home sweet home (home: H-O-M-E)
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)

Hey!
Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand (foot!)

And in the evening she's a singer with the band

Take Ob-la-di-bla-da (ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(ha ha ha ha)

Ahh...
Thank you (ha ha)
Bottle of claret for you if I'd realised.
Well, do next time.
I'd forgotten all about it, George, so I'm sorry. Will you forgive me?
Yes.
Cheeky bitch.

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number

Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Every one of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen times
Your fibres giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

Number 9, number 9

Who's to know?
Who was to know?

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

I sustained nothing worse than
Also spoken for
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

Number 9, number 9, number 9

Right, right
Right, right, right, right
Right, right

9, number 9, number 9, number 9

I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rouge doctors have brought this specimen

I have nobody's short-cuts, aha…

9, number 9

With the situation

They are standing still

The plan, the telegram

Ooh ooh

Number 9, number

Ooh

A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Who could tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive was high
And his eyes were low

All right!

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9

So the wife called, and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it
Right!
Yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the bloody Navy and went to sea

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I am not in the mood for wearing

Um da
Aaah

How?
The dogs were dogging, the cats were catting
The birds were birding, and the fish were fishing
The men were themming, and the when were whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

Number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The Twist

El Dorado

Take this, brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's not that; it's
What? What? Oh

Maybe even then
Exposures in London
It's a difficulty being
By exposure
Because it's almost like being naked

If you become naked

That line
Hold that line
Hold that line
Hold that line
Hold that line

Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Who knows how long I've loved you?
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know I will
I will

Mm
Da-da-da-da-da-da da
Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy name o' Rocky Raccoon-a
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

Rocky Raccoon
Checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come
Equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

His rival, it seems
Had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill
And she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy

Now, she and her man
Who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
A-Rocky burst in
And grinning a grin
He said, "Danny, boy, this is a showdown!"

But Daniel was hot
And he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Aah

Da-d'n da da da da da
Daa-d'l da da da da da
Daa-d'l da da da da da
Da-da da da-da ndoo ndoo-doo-doo
Dooodle-doo-doo-doo ndoo-doo-dooo
Dooodle-doo-doo-doo ndoo-doo-dooo
Doo doodle-doo doo-doodle-doo
Doo-doodle-doo doo-doodle-doo
La-ta ndoo dloo-doo-doo

Now the doctor came in
Stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better
I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"

A-now Rocky Raccoon
He fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible (Daa da-da-da)
A-Gideon checked out (Poor)
And he left it no doubt (Rocky)
To help with good Rocky's revival (Ohhh)

Aah
Oh, yeah, yeah'n
Doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo
Dooo doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo
Dooo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo
Ndoo doo-doo-doo
Dooo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo doo
Come on, Rocky, boy
Dooo d'n-doo doo doo-doo
Come on, Rocky, boy
Doo doo doo doo doo-ta-doo ta-doo-ta-da
A story of Rocky, da-da-da
She's not a girl who misses much
Do-do do-do do-do
Oh, yeah

She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multi-coloured mirror's on his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust

I need a fix, 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix, 'cause I'm going down

Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun

Happiness (happiness) is a warm gun (bang bang, shoot shoot)
Happiness (happiness) is a warm gun, mama (bang bang, shoot shoot)
When I hold you in my arms (oh, yeah)
And I feel (oo) my finger on your trigger (oh, yeah)
I know (oo) nobody can do me no harm (oh, yeah)
Because (happiness) is a warm gun, mama (bang bang, shoot shoot)
Happiness (happiness) is a warm gun, yes, it is (bang bang, shoot shoot)

Happiness is a warm - yes it is - gun (happiness)
(Bang bang, shoot shoot)
Well, don't you know that happiness (happiness)
Is a warm gun (is a warm gun), mama?
(Yeah)
She was a working girl
North of England way
(Now, she's hit the big time)
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say

Honey pie
You are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?

Oh, honey pie
My position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

You became a legend
Of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

Oh, honey pie
You are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie, come back to me

Oo
Yeah

I like it like that (oo, ah)
I like this kind of, hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me
Hollywood blues

Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me? t-t-tee
Now, honey pie
You are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?
Come, come back to me, honey pie, ha, ha, ha
Hoo-woo-doo ooh-ooh
Bo bo
Buh-huh-buh wa-ooh-uh bo bo
Honey pie, honey pie
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
(I'll tell you)

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He's the all-American bullet-headed Saxon mother's son
All de children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle, where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All de children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce", his mommy butted in
"If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him"
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

Eh up!
I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor
And I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and so-old you

I look at the world
And I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
(With) every mistake
We must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
Yeah

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No-one alerted you

I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently wee-ee-eeps

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Go
Now, it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now, the Sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now, the Moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

Mm, mm
Mm

Close your eyes, and I'll close mine (now, it's time to say good night)
Good night, sleep tight
Now, the Sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you

Good night
Good night, everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia
Oceanchild calls me
So I sing the song of love
Julia

Windy smile calls me

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering
Glimmering in the sun

I can only speak my mind
Julia

Touch me

Right, take two, OK!

You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out-in
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?

You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan

You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We all doing what we can

All I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?

You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
(Ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa, ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa)
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You'd better free your mind instead
(Ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa, ah-ooh shoo-be doo-wa)
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right?

All right?

All
Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting
Singing songs for everyone

Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty
Sound of music as she flies

Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing
A lazy song beneath the Sun

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Mm, Mother Nature's son
They say it's your birthday
Well, it's my birthday too, yeah
They say it's your birthday
We're gonna have a good time
I'm glad it's your birthday
Happy birthday to you

(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!)

Yes, we're going to a party, party
Yes, we're going to a party, party
Yes, we're going to a party, party

I would like you to dance (birthday)
Take a cha-cha-cha-chance (birthday)
I would like you to dance (birthday)
Dance, yeah

Whoo
Come on

Take a cha-cha-cha-chance (birthday)

Well, it's my birthday too, yeah
They say it's your birthday
We're gonna have a good time
I'm glad it's your birthday
Happy birthday to you
It's been a long, long, long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you?

It took a long, long, long time
Now, I'm so happy I found you
How I love you

So many tears I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh, oh

Now I can see you, be you
How can I ever misplace you?
How I want you
Oh, I love you
You know that I need you
Oh, I love you

Oh
I'm so tired
I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired
My mind is on the blink
I wonder, should I get up and fix myself a drink?
No, no, no

I'm so tired
I don't know what to do
I'm so tired
My mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you
But I know what you would do

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke
It's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep
I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks
I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind

I'm so tired
I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired
I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke
It's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep
I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks
I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better

The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

The duchess of Kirkcaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local bird and bee

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

At twelve o'clock a meeting 'round the table
For a séance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

Cry, baby, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry, baby, cry

Cry, cry, cry, baby
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
Cry, baby, cry
Cry, cry, cry

I told you 'bout Strawberry Fields
You know, the place where nothing is real
Well, here's another place you can go-o
Where everything flo-ows
Looking through the bent-backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion

I told you 'bout the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well, here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

I told you 'bout the fool on the hill
I tell you, man, he living there still
Well, here's another place you can be
Listen to me
Fixin' the hole in the ocean
Tryin' to make a dovetail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

(Sexy Sadie, oh) One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover
She came along to turn on everyone 
Sexy Sadie (Sexy Sadie)
The greatest (she's the greatest) of them all (wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa)

Sexy Sadie, how did you know
The world was waiting just for you?

Sexy Sadie (wa wa wa wa), oh, you'll get yours yet (wa wa wa)

(Sexy Sadie) We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table 
Just a smile would lighten everything 
Sexy Sadie (sexy Sadie)
She's the latest and the greatest (she's the greatest) of them all
(Sexy Sadie)
(She's the latest and the greatest of them all)

Woo

She made a fool of everyone

If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that

When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a northern song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When/As it's only a northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there

And I told you there's no-one there
To your mother!

It's all too much 
It's all too much 

When I look into your eyes 
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside 
The more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around you 
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take 
It's all too much 

Floating down the stream of time 
From life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are 
Or where you'd like to be 

It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake 
So take a piece but not too much 

Sell me on a silver sun 
Where I know that I'm free 
Show me that I'm everywhere 
And get me home for tea 

It's all too much for me to take
There's plenty there for everybody
The more you give, the more you get
The more it is and it's too much

Nice to have the time to take
This opportunity
Time for me to look at you
And you to look at me

It's all too much for me to see 
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know 
And what I do is all too much 

It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around you 
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take 
It's all too much 

It's too much
It's too much

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue 
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue 
You're too much
We are getting better

Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much

Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much

Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too
Sheepdog standing in the rain
Bullfrog doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

Childlike, no one understands
Jack-knife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Big man (yeah?) walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Whoo!
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Full steam ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye
Captain, captain

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Every one of us (every one of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine, ha-ha!)

We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go, I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go, I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
They're going to put me in the movies
They're going to make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I got to do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm going to be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movie's going to make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I’ll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I got to do is act naturally

We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm going to be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movie's going to make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I’ll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I got to do is act naturally

We said our goodbyes (Ah, the night before)
Love was in your eyes (Ah, the night before)
Now today I find
You have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

Were you telling lies? (Ah, the night before)
Was I so unwise? (Ah, the night before)
When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

Last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me want to cry

We said our goodbyes (Ah, the night before)
Love was in your eyes (Ah, the night before)
Now today I find
You have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

Yes

When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before (Hey)

Last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me want to cry

Were you telling lies? (Ah, the night before)
Was I so unwise? (Ah, the night before)
When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Like the night before
Though you've gone away this morning, you'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time if I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

You've tried before to leave me but you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

I really do and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it, I'd admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me, I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it I'd admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in

How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round, all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
You don't realise how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you

Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you

Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?

I didn't realise
As I looked in your eyes
You told me

Oh, yes, you told me
You don't want my lovin' any more
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on any more

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you

So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you

But when you told me
You don't want my lovin' any more
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on any more

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you

So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you
I need you

I need you
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
The way you rock and roll
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When you do the stroll
Come on, Miss Lizzy
Love me 'fore I grow too old

Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine
You make me dizzy, dizz, Lizzy
Ooh, girl, you look so fine

Run and tell your brother
Baby, don't run and hide
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
Girl, I want to marry you

Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine, girl
You make me dizzy, dizzy, Lizzy
Girl, you look so fine
You're just a-rockin' and a-rollin'
Ooh, I said I wish you were mine
I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

She said that living with me
Was bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

I don't know why she's ridin' so high
She oughta think twice
She oughta do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She oughta think twice
She oughta do right by me

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away, yeah

Oh, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

I don't know why she's ridin' so high
She oughta think twice
She oughta do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She oughta think twice
She oughta do right by me

She said that living with me
Was bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around

Oh, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
For I have got another girl
Another girl

You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl
Another girl

She's sweeter than all the girls and I've met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop
For I have got another girl

Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin, she will always be my friend

I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl

Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin, she will always be my friend

I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl
Another girl

Another girl
Help! I need somebody
Help! Not just anybody
Help! You know I need someone
Help!

(When)
When I was younger
(When I was young)
So much younger than today
(I never need)
I never needed anybody's help in any way

(Now)
But now these days are gone
(These days are gone)
I'm not so self-assured
(And now I find)
Now I find I've changed my mind
And opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

(Now)
And now my life has changed
(My life has changed)
In oh, so many ways
(My indepen)
My independence seems to vanish in the haze

(But)
But every now and then
(Now and then)
I feel so insecure
(I know that I)
I know that I just need you like
I never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

When I was younger
So much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way

(Now)
But now these days are gone
(These days are gone)
I'm not so self-assured
(And now I find)
Now I find I've changed my mind
I've opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

Help me, help me, ooh!
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

I have never known the like of this
I've been alone and I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

Oh, falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
If you let me take your heart
I will prove to you
We will never be apart
If I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me

Big and black the clouds may be
Time will pass away
If you put your trust in me
I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now
Tell me what you see
Don't you realise now?
What you see is me

Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time
How can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm
Tryin' to get to you?
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me

Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time
How can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm
Tryin' to get to you?
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me
I get high when I see you go by
My, oh my
When you sigh, my my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy
When I'm beside you?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes night-time bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up, girl?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes, it's so hard loving you
Loving you
